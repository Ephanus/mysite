            <p>Renowned type designer, Matthew Carter, has this to say about his
                profession:</p>
               <blockquote>
                
                   <p>Our alphabet hasn't changed in eons; there isn't much latitude in
                    what a designer can do with the individual letters.</p>
                    <p>Much like a piece of classical music, the score is written
                    down. It's not something that is tampered with, and yet, each
                    conductor interprets that score differently. There is tension in
                    the interpretation.</p>

                        <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
                        <p>This week I am extremely excited about a new
                        cooking technique called sous vide. In sous vide
                        cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed
                        in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely
                        set to the target temperature you want the food
                        to be cooked to. In his book, Cooking for Geeks,
                        Jeff Potter describes it as ultra-low-temperature
                        poaching.</p>
                        <p>Next month, we will be serving Sous Vide Salmon
                        with Dill Hollandaise. To reserve a seat at the chef
                        table, contact us before November 30.</p>

                        <p>Warning: Sous vide cooked salmon is not
                        pasteurized. Avoid it if you are pregnant or have
                        immunity issues.</p>
